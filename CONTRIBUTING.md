## Coding Standards

### Elixir Style Guide

We follow the standard [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide) with these additions:

#### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format your code before committing
mix format
```

#### Documentation
- Add `@doc` to all public functions
- Include examples in documentation
- Use proper typespecs with `@spec`

```elixir
@doc """
Request a payment from a consumer.

## Examples

    iex> config = %{subscription_key: "key", ...}
    iex> payment = %{amount: "100", currency: "UGX", ...}
    iex> Collections.request_to_pay(config, payment)
    {:ok, "reference-id-uuid"}
"""
@spec request_to_pay(config(), payment_request()) :: {:ok, String.t()} | {:error, term()}
def request_to_pay(config, payment) do
  # Implementation
end
```

#### Error Handling
- Use `{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}` tuples
- Provide structured error information
- Include helpful error messages

```elixir
case validate_payment(payment) do
  {:ok, validated_payment} ->
    # proceed
  {:error, validation_errors} ->
    {:error, {:validation_failed, validation_errors}}
end
```

#### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive function and variable names
- Follow Elixir naming conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for modules)
- Be consistent with existing code

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test

# Run specific test file
mix test test/collections_test.exs

# Run with coverage
mix test --cover

# Run tests continuously during development
mix test.watch
```

### Test Guidelines

1. **Write tests for all new functionality**
2. **Include both positive and negative test cases**
3. **Test error conditions thoroughly**
4. **Use descriptive test names**
5. **Mock external API calls using Mox**

#### Test Structure Example

```elixir
defmodule MomoapiElixir.CollectionsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  import Mox

  describe "request_to_pay/2" do
    test "returns reference_id on successful payment request" do
      # Setup mocks
      ClientMock
      |> expect(:post, fn _url, _body, _headers ->
        {:ok, %{status_code: 202, body: ""}}
      end)

      # Test
      result = Collections.request_to_pay(config, valid_payment)

      # Assert
      assert {:ok, reference_id} = result
      assert is_binary(reference_id)
    end

    test "returns validation errors for invalid payment" do
      invalid_payment = %{amount: ""}

      result = Collections.request_to_pay(config, invalid_payment)

      assert {:error, validation_errors} = result
      assert is_list(validation_errors)
    end
  end
end
```
